My First Readme
The last 2 weeks have been eventful. I have leanrt about a couple of things that would help me on the road to becoming a great Software Engineer. I have mastered Github, the use of command line and text editior tools, Emacs, Visual Studio and how to manipulate git.
I have also learnt how to build the right mindset, Grit and how to build a winning mentality.

I have created repositories, branch repositories, directories and files. I have made enteries into files, updated the enteries and deleted a directory.

Overall, I can say I am up to something good.
